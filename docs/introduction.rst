Introduction

RepEx is designed to be scalable, flexible, and above all, extensible. New developments in replica exchange (RE) are often limited to specific MD packages in which they were developed. RepEx aims to decouple the development of new advanced sampling algorithms from specific MD engines, and allows users to easily implement their cumstom RE algorithms and plug them into RepEx. RepEx also supports multiple MD engines including AMBER and GROMACS.
