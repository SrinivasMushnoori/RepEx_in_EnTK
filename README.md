# Enhanced RepEx

[WIP]: The backbone of the RepEx replica Exchange package implemented via the Ensemble Toolkit 0.6 API.


src/driver_main.py: run script for "dummy exchange" system performing 100 exchanges between 128 replicas. No actual "exchange" computation is occuring, purely data staging.


src/Exchange_Method.py: Exchange Method, T_Exchange being implemented currently.U_Exchange, S_Exchange and pH_Exchange will be implemented later during the development cycle. 



old_drivers/driver.py: run script in EnTK 0.4.6 API, no longer supported, to be removed.
